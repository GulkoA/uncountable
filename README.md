# Uncountable - Making Surgeries Safer with Computer Vision

>[!TIP]
> üèÜ **1st place at [Hack OHI/O 2023](https://hack.osu.edu/2023)**

Uncountable leverages cutting-edge Computer Vision technology to detect items forgotten in patients during surgery, ensuring a safer surgical environment. It was created in 24 hours during the 2023 HackOHI/O Hackathon, winning 1st place out of 200 teams. Using computer vision, Uncountable tracks surgical instruments during a procedure, alerting the surgeon if any instruments are left inside the patient.

## Architecture

![Architecture](assets/uncountable-architecture.png)

The architecture of Uncountable is designed to ensure high-performance real-time tracking and alerting during surgical procedures. It consists of the following components:

1. **Main Electron.js process (backend)**:
  - Spawns and manages Python child processes for object detection and tracking.
  - Manages runtime configuration and communication with the frontend application.

2. **Computer Vision Module**:
  - Utilizes fine-tuned **YOLOv8** model for object detection to identify and track surgical instruments.
  - **Pytorch** is used for model training and inference.
  - **Websockets** are used for real-time data transmission.

3. **Renderer Electron.js process (frontend)**:
  - Displays the real-time video feed from the camera with overlaid instrument tracking.
  - Provides a user interface for configuring the system and viewing alerts.
  - Communicates directly with the Pyhon child processes for object detection and tracking.
  - Built with pute **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for performance and responsiveness.

## Physical setup

To create a computer vision software, we first needed some hardware: A ‚Äúbudget-conscious‚Äù cardboard box to simulate a patient‚Äôs body and a top-down web camera to capture the movement of the instruments. We found both in a matter of 30 minutes (running all around campus) and started the works.

We decided to base our model off YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection model, and enhanced its performance by collecting a custom dataset of instrument images. We took pictures of every related tool we could find at the hackathon: plastic knives, scissors, tissues, and hands in the view of the camera to fine-tune object detection and background subtraction.

Collected images can be found in the `images` folder of this repo.
